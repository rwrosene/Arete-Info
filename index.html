            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
            
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: What kind of images can I add to Arete Digital Closet?</summary>
                <p>A: You can add a variety of images to help you organize your fashion life! This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Photos of clothes you already own.</li>
                        <li>Pictures or screenshots of clothes you want to buy (your wishlist).</li>
                        <li>Inspiration photos of outfits or individual pieces you like from online, social media, etc.</li>
                        <li>Photos of your own outfits that you've put together.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: How does the "Outfits" tab work?</summary>
                <p>A: The Outfits tab is your space to create and store outfit ideas. Currently, this is a manual process where you can group photos of items together to form an outfit. Think of it as a digital way to lay out your clothes and see how they work together. We plan to add features to automatically identify clothes in photos and label them for you in future updates!</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: What are "Boards" for?</summary>
                <p>A: Boards allow you to curate collections of photos for specific themes, occasions, trips, or vibes. For example, you could create a board for "Summer Vacation Looks," "Work Outfit Ideas," or "Wedding Guest Attire." It's a flexible way to visually group your items and inspiration.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: How can Arete Digital Closet help me improve my outfits or manage my wardrobe?</summary>
                <p>A: By centralizing all your fashion-related images, Arete helps you:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visualize Your Wardrobe:</strong> See what you own without having to physically look through your closet, which is especially helpful when you're out shopping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan Outfits:</strong> Experiment with different combinations in the "Outfits" tab.</li>
                        <li><strong>Curate Inspiration:</strong> Keep all your style ideas (from Pinterest, Instagram, etc.) in one organized place using "Boards" or by adding them to "Items."</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify Gaps or Overlaps:</strong> Seeing your clothes and outfits digitally can help you notice if you're missing key pieces, have too many similar items, or tend to create similar outfits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Streamline Shopping:</strong> Use the "List" tab as a dedicated shopping list for items you want, ensuring you remember what you're looking for.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: How does the "List" tab work? Is it different from adding "clothes I want" to the Items tab?</summary>
                <p>A: The "List" tab functions as a dedicated shopping or wishlist. You can add items you want directly here, or if you add an item to the main "Items" tab and categorize it as "want," it will also appear in the "List" tab for a quick overview. This makes it easy to see all the items you're considering purchasing in one place.</p>
            </details>

             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: Can I get help with styling or shopping questions directly through the app?</summary>
                <p>A: Yes! If you'd like personalized advice, you can go to your Settings in the app and turn on "Allow Stylist Access." Once enabled, and after you've added photos of your items or products you're considering, you can text us with some context, and we'll be happy to help.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: Where are my photos stored? Do they take up space on my iPhone?</summary>
                <p>A: When you add photos to Arete Digital Closet, they are stored within the app's private storage. While the app itself and its data (including your images) will take up some space on your iPhone, it helps to keep these fashion-specific photos separate and organized outside of your main camera roll. We recommend ensuring you have adequate storage space on your device for the best experience.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Q: What new features are you planning?</summary>
                <p>A: We're excited about the future of Arete! Some features we're actively working on for upcoming versions include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatic labeling of clothes in your photos.</li>
                        <li>Easier ways to upload products directly from web links (so you don't always have to screenshot).</li>
                        <li>Outfit suggestions and the ability to identify pieces in inspiration photos, then add them to your "wants" or "owns" list.</li>
                        <li>Exploring ways to integrate outfit creation more seamlessly with your item photos.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We always appreciate user feedback for future development, so please share your ideas!
